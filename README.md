# 🍓 Fruit Freshness Detection using CNN with ResNet50 

A deep learning-powered system that classifies fruit images as **Fresh** or **Spoiled**.  
This application allows you to drag & drop an image of a fruit and get an instant freshness prediction — designed for real-world use in warehouse conveyor-belt setups.

## 🚀 Project Overview  
In modern fruit-processing warehouses, quality control is critical. This project aims to automate the inspection process using high-speed cameras and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).  
- Images of fruit crates are captured in real time as they move on conveyor belts.  
- A CNN model classifies each fruit image as “Fresh” or “Spoiled”.  
- The system streamlines inspection, reduces human error, and helps minimise wastage.

## 🧠 Model Details  
- **Base architecture**: ResNet50 (pre-trained on ImageNet)  
- **Customisation**:  
  - Freeze all layers except `layer4` + the final fully connected layer  
  - Replace the final FC layer with `Dropout(0.2)` + `Linear(in_features, num_classes)`  
- **Classes**: `Fresh`, `Spoiled`  
- **Training data**: ~16,000 images  
- **Target categories**: 16 fruit-types (e.g., Banana, Lemon, Lulo, Mango, Orange, Strawberry, Tamarillo, Tomato…)  
- **Performance**: > 90 % accuracy on validation set

## 🧰 Technology Stack  
- Python 3.x  
- PyTorch (for model definition & training)  
- torchvision (for data loaders & transforms)  
- PIL (for image handling)  
- Streamlit (for front-end drag & drop app)

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions  

1. **Clone this repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fruit-freshness-detection.git
   cd fruit-freshness-detection
## ⚙️ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
## Ensure model weights are placed
 Save your trained weights file as: model/saved_model.pth
## Run the Streamlit app
 streamlit run app.py
## Use the app
Drag or upload a fruit image (supported formats: JPG, PNG)

The interface will show whether the fruit is Fresh or Spoiled

# 📊 Training & Validation Overview
- Built baseline CNN models before adopting transfer learning with ResNet50.

- Applied data augmentation (random flip, rotation, color jitter, resize) to improve generalisation.

- Partitioned data into training, validation, and test sets.

- Visualised representative samples to understand class balance and data quality.

- Tuned hyperparameters (learning rate, epochs, dropout) to avoid overfitting and maximise validation performance.
# 🛠️ Next Steps & Enhancements
Integrate with actual conveyor-belt camera feeds for live inference.

Extend the model to classify multiple fruits in a single image / crate.

Deploy on edge-devices (e.g., Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi) for real-time on-site use.

Explore further model regularisation (batch-norm, dropout) and advanced architectures for improved accuracy.
